### maps Project:-
Simple page web app running AJAX requests, [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), ([Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) - in development)
Javascript framework : [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/)
Layout is handled via [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

### List of files & directories:-
1. CSS directory - .css styles
2. JS directory - app.js and map.js javascript files
3. index.html

#### How to do?
1. Add unique functionality beyond the minimum requirements (i.e. the ability to “favorite” a location, etc.).
2. Incorporate a build process allowing for production quality, minified code, to be delivered to the client.
3. Data persists when the app is closed and reopened, either through localStorage or an external database (e.g. Firebase).
4. Include additional third-party data sources beyond the minimum required.
5. Style different markers in different (and functionally-useful) ways, depending on the data set.
6. Implement additional optimizations that improve the performance and user experience of the filter functionality (keyboard shortcuts, autocomplete functionality, filtering of multiple fields, etc).
7. Integrate all application components into a cohesive and enjoyable user experience.
8. Completely restyle the so-far barebone map structure. Functionality needs to be
reviewed first before stylization.
May set 1on1 for some guidance...

#### Progress of work:-
Using [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/) for getting the places and providing additional information for infoWindows ALONG the [Wikipedia](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) information.

### Execution:-
After downloading the repo's contents, open index.html in any browser of your choice (Chrome recommended).
